FLASH Bridge Team - Custom MXE Implementation Ready for API Key Access
```

## 📝 **Email Body**

```
Dear Arcium Team,

I'm reaching out on behalf of the FLASH Bridge development team. We've built a comprehensive custom MXE (Multi-Party Computation eXecution Environment) specifically designed for privacy-preserving cross-chain bridging operations.

Our Implementation:
==================

✅ Complete Custom MXE Project
- Bridge-specific encrypted instructions using Arcis framework
- Four custom MPC operations: amount encryption, verification, swap calculation, BTC address privacy
- Full Solana program integration with #[arcium_program] macro
- Comprehensive TypeScript testing suite
- Production-ready documentation and build scripts

✅ Bridge-Specific Operations
- encrypt_bridge_amount: Privacy-preserving transfer amounts
- verify_bridge_transaction: Private compliance verification
- calculate_swap_amount: Front-running protection for ZEC→SOL swaps
- encrypt_btc_address: Regulatory compliance for withdrawals

✅ Professional Architecture
- Proper project structure (Arcium.toml, encrypted-ixs/, programs/)
- Event-driven callbacks and error handling
- Institutional-grade security design
- Ready for deployment to your network

Files Available:
===============
- flash-bridge-mxe/Arcium.toml (Configuration)
- flash-bridge-mxe/encrypted-ixs/bridge_privacy.rs (MPC operations)
- flash-bridge-mxe/programs/src/lib.rs (Solana integration)
- flash-bridge-mxe/tests/bridge-privacy.ts (Test suite)
- flash-bridge-mxe/README.md (Full documentation)

Our Commitment:
==============
- Serious MPC integration (not just SDK consumption)
- Custom operations tailored for bridge privacy
- Ready to deploy and contribute to Arcium ecosystem
- Institutional focus with real compliance requirements

Request:
=======
Please provide API key access so we can:
1. Deploy our custom MXE to your testnet
2. Test real MPC operations
3. Launch the first institutional bridge with genuine privacy

We're eager to become an Arcium showcase project and demonstrate how MPC can revolutionize cross-chain DeFi privacy.
